Webpack is a code bundler.


It takes code and transforms it into vanilla ES5 javascript.

It is used under the hood for React.

The src folder is where all our code goes, anything we write goes into the src folder

The dist folder is where all the static assets go, Webpack creates these static assets from our src code
